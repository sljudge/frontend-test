# cord Coding Challenge (Front-end)

### Introduction 
React take home test for Cord. 
Hooks used for ease and readability.
Minimal librairies brought in: gsap for use expanding the sidebar (could also be implemented elsewhere to improve feel of drop downs), immer for absolute guarantee of non-mutable state and lodash for debounce.

### Improvements
Animate drop downs with gsap
Animate transitions - icons and movie items
Finish off filter functionality to include votes and language - may need to bring setter up to Filter parent component
Pagination
Save/watched movie functionality

### Run
npm i
npm run start
